Here's a suggested `README.md` for your test directory, covering the structure, purpose, and usage of tests in your project.

# Testing Guide for `movietrack`

This guide covers the structure, conventions, and commands for running tests in the `movietrack` project. The `src/tests` directory contains unit, integration, and end-to-end (E2E) tests, organized as follows:

## Directory Structure

```
tests
├── __mocks__                 # Mock files and configurations for Jest
│   ├── next.ts               # Mock for Next.js (if applicable)
│   └── themeMock.js          # Mock for theme-related tests
├── e2e                       # End-to-end tests
│   ├── backend
│   │   └── movies.e2e.test.js # E2E tests for backend endpoints
│   └── frontend
│       └── moviesFrontend.e2e.test.ts # E2E tests for frontend behavior
├── integration               # Integration tests
│   ├── backend
│   │   └── moviesController.test.js # Integration tests for backend controllers
│   └── frontend
│       └── MovieList.test.js # Integration tests for frontend components
├── unit                      # Unit tests for services and utilities
│   └── movieService.test.js
├── README.md                 # Testing documentation (this file)
└── react-test-renderer.d.ts  # Types for react-test-renderer if needed
```

## Types of Tests

### 1. **Unit Tests (`tests/unit/`)**
- **Purpose**: Test individual functions, utilities, and services in isolation.
- **Examples**: `movieService.test.js` tests functions within the `movieService`.
- **Run Command**: `npm run test:unit`

### 2. **Integration Tests (`tests/integration/`)**
- **Purpose**: Test the integration between components or modules, ensuring they work together as expected.
- **Examples**:
    - `backend/moviesController.test.js`: Tests backend controller functions and API routes.
    - `frontend/MovieList.test.js`: Tests interactions and data flow in frontend components.
- **Run Command**: `npm run test:integration`

### 3. **End-to-End (E2E) Tests (`tests/e2e/`)**
- **Purpose**: Simulate real-world user flows and test the application as a whole, from frontend to backend.
- **Examples**:
    - `backend/movies.e2e.test.js`: Tests full backend API flows for movies.
    - `frontend/moviesFrontend.e2e.test.ts`: Tests user interactions and application behavior on the frontend.
- **Run Command**: `npm run test:e2e`

## Running Tests

In the `package.json` file, custom scripts are defined to run specific types of tests:

- **Run All Tests**: `npm test`
- **Unit Tests Only**: `npm run test:unit`
- **Integration Tests Only**: `npm run test:integration`
- **E2E Tests Only**: `npm run test:e2e`

These commands utilize Jest to execute the tests, and each test file should be named using the `.test.js` or `.test.ts` convention for consistency.

## Testing Conventions

1. **Naming**: Test files follow the `.test.js` or `.test.ts` suffix.
2. **Mocking**: Use mocks in the `__mocks__` directory to simulate external dependencies or Next.js-specific modules.
3. **Snapshots**: Use snapshots for React component testing where applicable, especially in frontend component tests.
4. **Error Handling**: Log meaningful error messages and add assertions for expected behaviors in case of failures.

## Example Test Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Run end-to-end tests
npm run test:e2e
```

## Additional Notes

- **Setup**: Some tests may require global setup or teardown, configured in `jest.setup.js` or other Jest configuration files.
- **Typescript**: Ensure `@types/jest` is installed for TypeScript tests, and use `react-test-renderer.d.ts` for custom typings if required.
- **Error Boundaries**: For React components, use error boundaries to catch errors during rendering in test environments.

## Troubleshooting

- **Theme Errors**: If you encounter theme-related errors, ensure that `themeMock.js` or similar mock configurations are correctly implemented and imported where necessary.
- **Path Aliases**: Check Jest configuration for module aliases if tests cannot locate imports like `@/frontend/modules/...`.
